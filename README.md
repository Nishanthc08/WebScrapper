# WebScrapper

This project is a basic web scraper that uses Python with BeautifulSoup and requests libraries. The goal is to scrape quotes from a website called "quotes to scrape" and print them out. This introduces you to the basics of web scraping, handling HTTP requests, and parsing HTML content.

Requirements:

    Python 3
    BeautifulSoup4
    requests

This script demonstrates how to perform a GET request to a webpage, parse the returned HTML to find specific elements, and extract the text content from those elements.
